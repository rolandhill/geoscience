    -Fix bug where the last downhole interval can go past the end of hole
    -Fix error when writing/reading project data (possibly only Linux)
  1.6
    -Fix problem finding source data layer after the user updates their layer by recreating the it.
    -Prevent plugin trying to recreate sections and crashing when there are no source layers.
    -Eliminate warning about implicit conversion.
  1.5
    -Fix problem desurveying holes when no 0 depth value in survey file
    -Ignore surveys if dip or azimuth are not valid numbers
  1.4
    -Alpha and beta structural reading conversion to dip and dip direction
  1.3

  1.1 
	-Fix log file creation for Mac
  1.0
	-Generate and display drill sections.
	-Improved workflow
  0.7
    -Ensure drill hole ids are strings and collar coordinates, survey data and down hole distances are numbers.
	-Add Readme markdown and license file (Thanks KoalaGeo).
  0.62
    -Fix log file path issue on Linux.
	-Added Select All/None box to field selector box.
